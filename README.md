# PicoCTF-Write-Ups
Write-ups for PicoCTF challenges.

PicoCTF's official site: https://picoctf.org/

PicoCTF is an extensive cybersecurity capture the flag (CTF) event.
Challenges have different categories; e.g. cryptography, reverse engineering, etc.
They take time to complete, and write-ups have been an extra project for me.
These are all the following write-ups I've done for the PicoCTF challenge thus far.
They are in the MS Word format so users can easily add in their own comments if necessary.

PicoCTF often has hints to solve the challenge within its title; e.g. the challenge titled “get aHEAD” requires you to use to the “HEAD” HTTP request.  Helpful resources can be found on PicoCTF’s site under their “Learn” tab.

Information about challenges are in their titles: respectively the challenge title, point value, and category.
>E.g. a file titled "Get Ahead 20pts web exploitation" has the following attributes:
	*challenge title = Get Ahead
	*points = 20
	*category = web exploitation
